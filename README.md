# work/task productivity assistant

This is a productivity tool that will help keep suers stay on track with completing their desired tasks in their desired timeline, keep them off distraction websites, and will help them along the way by sending them reminders and giving them curated study guides based off their task and timeline and suggestions for how to improve for the next work session. 

- it’ll send user pop up reminders/messages when you are on webpages that are labeled “distraction”. (focus mode)
- Create study plan for users when the user feeds it information
    - the info the user feeds it is what the task is (description of task), what the timeline for the user to finish the task is, and the links to “distraction” websites that the user wants to stay off of when they’re in working mode
- the study assistant will then give user an option to “start studying”. During this time the work/study/task assistant will set up a pomodoro timer for the user and during this time the study assistant is going to collect the user’s activity for example what websites it goes to, how long they spend on the distraction websites, how long user spends on actually studying/working. It turns this information into scores for the user (scores of how well the user did).
- usecase for when the user enters any “distraction” websites, the user will get a popup reminder message telling them that this is a distraction website and that they should go back to their task.
- When user clicks on “done for the day” option after their studying is done. The assistant will give them a summary of how well they did so give the scores of the time they spent studying and the time they spent on distractions. how many tasks they got done from their desired/created checklist of tasks, etc. And it will also give productivity suggestions and tips on how to better improve their studying/work for the next study session based off how they did currently.
